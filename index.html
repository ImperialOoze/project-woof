			<h2>How to Handle</h2>
			<p><b>Newfoundlands are naturally kind but be sure to take him/her with you to many places when they are puppies so they do not become scared/hostile when going to new places. This also makes them social.</b></p>
			<p><b>Make sure to train them when young so you don't have a 125 lb beast you can't control.</b></p>
			<p><b>If you got your puppy from a breeder, make sure you feed him the same foods until adulthood to minimize digestive upsets. </b></p>
